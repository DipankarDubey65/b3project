        <p>Thane : A minor boy was feared swept away in a swollen
            downstream at Parsik hills while three others suffered injuries in various rain related
            mishaps in Thane, officials informed Thursday evening after torrential rains hit the area.
The boy and a man, both residents of Bhaskar Nagar in Kalwa east were taken unawares and got swept in a
            gush of water than came down the Parsik hills following the heavy rains late Thursday
            evening. “While the man was rescued, the minor boy is still missing. Authorities have been
            alerted about the incident,” informed Milind Patil, former NCP corporator from Kalwa. Two
            houses have also suffered damages in the neighbouring Gholai Nagar area, added Patil.
            However, the civic officials were yet to confirm the incidents at the time of filing this
            report. Meanwhile, a 22-yearold two storeyed building in Mahatma Phule Nagar in Thane was
            evacuated after a portion of the structure started sinking late Thursday due to heavy
            rains. In another incident, two residents were injured after their house wall collapsed in Ram Nagar area.

            Supreme Court stays demolition of Curlie's restaurant in Goa
The Supreme Court on Friday stayed the demolition of Curlie's restaurant in Goa. Earlier,
            the National Green Tribunal (NGT) had ordered the restaurant's demolition, alleging that
            it was flouting the coastal zone regulation. The restaurant recently came in the news for
            its link to the death of BJP leader Sonali Phogat. It was alleged that Phogat was drugged
            at a party at the restaurant, hours before her death.

Those green bubbles that appear around text messages you send to your friends and family with iPhones don't appear to be going away anytime soon.

Apple CEO Tim Cook seemed to reject the idea of adopting a new messaging protocol on the company's devices that would make communicating with Android users smoother.

"I don't hear our users asking that we put a lot of energy in on that at this point," Cook said about implementing the RCS standard on iPhones, according to The Verge. He was speaking during Vox Media's Code 2022 event on Wednesday.

Apple uses its own iMessage service.

When Vox Media's LiQuan Hunt complained to Cook that his mother couldn't see the videos he sent her because they had different phones, the Apple chief replied: "Buy your mom an iPhone."

The blue and green bubbles, explained
In the early days of mobile messaging, cell phone users could send each other short text messages of no more than 160 characters. That was called SMS, or Short Message Service.

MMS, or Multimedia Message Service, built on that by allowing users to send a photo or short video.

Now texting is much more than that. That's where RCS – which stands for Rich Communication Services – comes in.

RCS is a new messaging standard used by Google and other telecom companies that supports group chats and read receipts, lets users send higher quality photos and videos and has end-to-end encryption, among other features.

If it sounds a lot like iMessage, that's because it is.

But iMessage is only available to Apple users. When an Android user texts someone with an iPhone, their message appears as an SMS or MMS message, because Apple doesn't support RCS. Hence the pixelated images and buggy group chats.

Texts sent via iMessage show up as blue bubbles on iPhones, while their SMS/MMS counterparts are green.

Google rolled out RCS for Android users in the U.S. in 2019. The company has launched a PR campaign aimed at shaming Apple into adopting RCS, but so far the iPhone maker hasn't budged.

Internal Apple emails showed executives arguing that allowing iMessage on Android devices would "hurt us more than help us" and that restricting the app to Apple users had a "serious lock-in" effect, according to The Verge.

            <p>Certificates are based on public key cryptography, which uses pairs of digital keys (very long numbers) to encrypt, or encode, information so it can be read only by its intended recipient. The recipient then decrypts (decodes) the information to read it.

A key pair contains a public key and a private key. The owner distributes the public key and makes it available to anyone. But the owner never distributes the private key; it is always kept secret. Because the keys are mathematically related, data encrypted with one key can be decrypted only with the other key in the pair.

A certificate is like a passport: it identifies the holder and provides other important information. Certificates are issued by a trusted third party called a Certification Authority (CA). The CA is analogous to passport office: it validates the certificate holder’s identity and signs the certificate so that it cannot be forged or tampered with. Once a CA has signed a certificate, the holder can present it as proof of identity and to establish encrypted, confidential communications.

Most importantly, a certificate binds the owner’s public key to the owner’s identity. Like a passport binds a photograph to personal information about its holder, a certificate binds a public key to information about its owner.

In addition to the public key, a certificate typically includes information such as:

The name of the holder and other identification, such as the URL of the Web server using the certificate, or an individual’s email address.

The name of the CA that issued the certificate.

An expiration date.

Digital Certificates are governed by the technical specifications of the X.509 format. To verify the identity of a user in the certificate realm, the authentication service verifies an X.509 certificate, using the common name field of the X.509 certificate as the principal name.</p>
